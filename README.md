# PyBerAnalysis

## Overview

The scenario for this module is that we have been tasked with creating a summary DataFram of the ride-sharing data for PyBer. The DataFrame is to be used to analyze the data that the company has collected indexed by city type. Additionally we are to prepare a line graph showing the sum of fares for each city type, dispayed by week, over a four-month timeframe. This analysis will summarize how the data differs according to the type of city in order for the decision-makers to make informed decisions for the future of the company.
